--- Paper 2: Converting Equipment Control Software from Pascal to C/C++ ---
### **Problem Statement**  
The GSI accelerator's equipment control (EC) software was written in Pascal, with no modern cross-development tools available for Pascal. The system runs on VMS, which expires support by 2001, and the software is complex, requiring preservation of real-time functionality. Modern development practices (C++/Java) are needed, but legacy hardware (400 VME boards) cannot be replaced, and conversion must not disrupt daily operations.  

---

### **Methodology**  
The paper outlines the conversion of Pascal code to C/C++ using:  
1. **Automated tools**: The Pascal to C translator (p2c) handles most data structures and logic.  
2. **Manual adjustments**: Perl scripts adjust identifier notation, handle data structure mismatches (e.g., packed records vs. C), and manage linking of Pascal/C modules.  
3. **Key steps**:  
   - Convert 170,000 lines of Pascal code to C, preserving real-time functionality.  
   - Address compatibility issues (e.g., integer sizes, pointer types).  
   - Apply a style guide via Perl scripts to ensure consistency.  
   - Manual interaction for critical aspects (e.g., data structure alignment, pointer semantics).  

---

### **Key Results**  
1. **Conversion outcomes**:  
   - 15 device classes converted, with software operation for over 6 months.  
   - 39 person-months (approx. 3.25 person-years) required for 170,000 LOC code, compared to 2 person-weeks for 2200 LOC.  
   - p2c and Perl scripts reduced manual effort by 2–4 times compared to manual conversion and 10 times faster than redevelopment.  

2. **Challenges addressed**:  
   - Resolved issues like pointer arithmetic errors (e.g., miscalculated pointers due to type casting).  
   - Ensured compatibility with VMS-era hardware and real-time constraints.  

3. **Impact**:  
   - Software quality improved, with bug fixing rare due to automated tools.  
   - Re-engineering the EC software was feasible within manpower limits, avoiding excessive labor.  

---  
**Conclusion**: Automated tools (p2c/Perl) enabled efficient conversion of Pascal code to C/C++, balancing automation with manual oversight. The method validated feasibility while maintaining real-time functionality and compatibility with legacy hardware.

### **Key Challenges in Testing the Legacy Application**  
The project faced significant hurdles during the testing phase, categorized into three main areas: **initial state of the legacy application**, **data formats**, and **batch performance**. Each section highlights specific obstacles, examples, and lessons learned.

---

### **1. Initial State of the Legacy Application**  
**Challenges:**  
- **Lack of Tests:**  
  - Most legacy components lacked sufficient test coverage, leading to manual analysis of inputs, outputs, and internal behavior.  
  - Complex batch jobs (e.g., CA7) required months of work to debug, causing delays.  

- **Batch Automation:**  
  - The CA7 batch scheduler was not installed in the mainframe test region.  
  - Control-M was manually configured in a new test region, requiring unplanned effort.  

- **Obsolete Code:**  
  - Over 35 years of use had accumulated outdated code.  
  - Removing this code reduced translation and testing workload.  

- **Interfaces with Other Systems:**  
  - 3500+ daily data file feeds and reports to downstream systems.  
  - Unknown consumers, insecure protocols, and varied configurations caused delays in upgrading protocols and harmonizing configurations.  

---

### **2. Data Formats**  
**Challenges:**  
- **EBCDIC to ASCII Conversion:**  
  - Mainframe files (e.g., EBCDIC) required conversion to ASCII for Linux compatibility.  
  - Computational fields (e.g., COMP3) needed to remain binary, requiring ETL tools and additional development.  
  - Large volumes of files and versions added complexity.  

- **Linux File Processing Tools:**  
  - Lack of tools for inspecting/modify/var/block files forced the development of new tools.  
  - These tools were not part of the original plan, leading to delays.  

- **Batch Performance:**  
  - **Multi-layout VSAM KSDS Files:**  
    - Translating to multiple tables (e.g., 97 tables) caused performance issues due to open cursors and data access logic.  
    - Mapping to a single table improved performance but increased maintenance complexity (fewer null-value columns).  

  - **In-Memory VSAM Cache:**  
    - Testing caused performance issues when batch jobs relied on shared database tables.  
    - In-memory caching eliminated network latency but prevented parallel execution of other batch jobs.  

---

### **3. Batch Performance**  
**Challenges:**  
- **Multi-layout VSAM KSDS Files:**  
  - Translating to multiple tables (e.g., 97 tables) led to slow operations due to open cursors and data access logic.  
  - Redesigning to a single table improved performance but increased maintenance complexity.  

- **In-Memory VSAM Cache:**  
  - Testing caused performance issues when batch jobs relied on shared database tables.  
  - In-memory caching eliminated latency but prevented parallel execution of other batch jobs.  

---

### **4. Types of Issues Not Caught in Testing**  
**Examples:**  
- **Unexpected User Input:**  
  - A subscriber’s complaint about non-delivery over 147 days caused a date overflow error.  
  - The job failed due to incorrect truncation, but the system did not log the error.  

- **Concurrency Issues:**  
  - Two batch jobs scheduled to run simultaneously wrote to the same output file, corrupting data.  
  - The corrupted data was loaded into an in-memory VSAM cache, causing a critical failure.  

- **Inefficient Processing Idioms:**  
  - Maintenance operations (e.g., DELETE/INSERT) locked databases for hours, causing outages.  
  - These jobs were redeveloped to use in-database operations or decommissioned.  

---

### **Lessons Learned**  
1. **Application Understanding:**  
   - Modernization projects often face delays due to poor legacy understanding.  
   - Deep application knowledge was critical for redesigning maintenance workflows and optimizing performance.  

2. **Testing as a Foundation:**  
   - Testing is critical but must account for real-world constraints (e.g., EBCDIC conversions, concurrency, and legacy code).  
   - Initial state improvements (e.g., testing and automation) reduced risks in later phases.  

3. **Infrastructure and Tools:**  
   - Legacy systems require careful migration of data formats and tools.  
   - In-memory caching and performance bottlenecks must be addressed proactively.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The testing process revealed the complexities of legacy systems, including data format mismatches, performance bottlenecks, and concurrency challenges. Key lessons emphasize the importance of application understanding, robust testing, and infrastructure planning to minimize risks during modernization.

--- Paper 4: Shadow Symbolic Execution with Java PathFinder ---
### **Evaluation Results and Analysis**

The evaluation of Shadow/J.alt PF demonstrated its effectiveness in generating regression tests for Java programs, particularly in complex scenarios involving **DiffExpressions** and **branching bytecode**. Below is a structured analysis of the results and their implications:

---

### **Key Findings**

1. **Test Case Generation**  
   - **Shadow/J.alt PF** generated **more test cases** than pure **SPF** (the baseline tool). This is attributed to its ability to handle **DiffExpressions** and **branching bytecode**, which allow for deeper exploration of symbolic states and conditional logic.  
   - The tool successfully explored **multiple paths** (e.g., `sametrue`, `samefalse`, `difftrue`, `difffalse`) and **dynamically merged symbolic and shadow expressions**, enabling more comprehensive test coverage.

2. **Handling Complex Code**  
   - **DiffExpressions** were critical in managing **symbolic and shadow divergences** between program versions. For example, when operands had divergent symbolic or shadow expressions, the tool correctly constructed **DiffExpressions** to preserve state consistency, allowing for accurate test case generation.  
   - **Branching bytecode** was effectively handled by the tool, enabling it to explore **conditional paths** (e.g., `if(change(x>1, x<=5))`) and generate test cases that reflect the behavior of both program versions.

3. **Performance Considerations**  
   - The tool's performance was constrained by the **complexity of the codebase**. For **code with many DiffExpressions**, the overhead of managing symbolic states and merging expressions increased computational costs.  
   - The **number of mutants** (51 in the experiment) was relatively small, but the tool's ability to generate **relevant test cases** (e.g., covering divergent paths) was effective for the tested artifacts.

---

### **Comparison with SPF**

- **SPF** (the baseline) focused on **concolic execution** (symbolic execution with concrete values) and **static attribute objects**.  
- **Shadow/J.alt PF** extended SPF by:  
  - **Supporting DiffExpressions** to handle **symbolic and shadow divergences**.  
  - **Implementing branching bytecode** to explore conditional paths dynamically.  
  - **Automatically merging symbolic and shadow expressions** when operands diverged, reducing the need for manual intervention.

---

### **Limitations and Challenges**

1. **Computational Overhead**  
   - The tool's performance degraded with **complex code** (e.g., nested conditions, multiple DiffExpressions), requiring optimizations for large-scale testing.

2. **Scalability**  
   - The number of **test cases** generated was limited by the **number of mutants** and the **density of DiffExpressions** in the codebase. For highly complex programs, the tool may not outperform SPF in terms of **speed** but excels in **coverage**.

3. **Source Code vs. Binary**  
   - The evaluation relied on **binary artifacts** (e.g., compiled Java code) instead of source code. This limitation may affect the **accuracy** of test case generation for code with non-trivial logic, as the tool relies on **symbolic execution** of compiled binaries.

---

### **Conclusion**

Shadow/J.alt PF demonstrated **significant effectiveness** in generating regression tests for Java programs, particularly in scenarios involving **complex branching logic** and **symbolic state management**. Its ability to **handle DiffExpressions** and **branching bytecode** enabled it to explore **more test cases** than SPF, even with limited mutants. However, the tool's performance was constrained by **code complexity** and **computational resources**.

**Recommendations**:
- Optimize the tool for **large-scale codebases** by improving **symbolic state management** and **branching execution** efficiency.  
- Consider integrating **source code analysis** for **non-trivial logic** to enhance test case relevance.  
- Explore **parallel execution** or **heuristic-based pruning** to reduce computational overhead for complex programs.

This evaluation underscores the value of Shadow/J.alt PF in **regression testing** for Java code, especially in scenarios where **symbolic execution** and **conditional logic** are critical.
