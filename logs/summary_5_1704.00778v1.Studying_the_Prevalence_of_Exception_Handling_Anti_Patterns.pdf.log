Abstract—Modern programming languages, such as Java and
C#, typically provide features that handle exceptions. These
features separate error-handling code from regular source code
and are proven to enhance the practice of software reliability,
comprehension, and maintenance. Having acknowledged the
advantages of exception handling features, the misuse of them
can still cause catastrophic software failures, such as application
crash. Prior studies suggested anti-patterns of exception han-
dling; while little knowledge was shared about the prevalence of
these anti-patterns. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence
of exception-handling anti-patterns. We collected a thorough list
of exception anti-patterns from 16 open-source Java and C#
libraries and applications using an automated exception ﬂow
analysis tool. We found that although exception handling anti-
patterns widely exist in all of our subjects, only a few anti-
patterns (e.g.Unhandled Exceptions, Catch Generic, Unreachable
Handler, Over-catch, andDestructive Wrapping) can be commonly
identiﬁed. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that the prevalence of anti-
patterns illustrates differences between C# and Java. Our results
call for further in-depth analyses on the exception handling
practices across different languages.
I. INTRODUCTION
Exception handling features, such as throw statements and
try-catch-ﬁnally blocks, are widely used in modern program-
ming languages. These features separate error-handling code
from regular code and are proven to enhance the practice
of software reliability, comprehension, and maintenance [1],
[2]. On the other hand, the misuse of exception handling
features can cause catastrophic failures [3]. A prior study
shows that two-thirds of the studied system crashes were due
to exceptions [4]. Barbosaet al. [5] illustrate the importance of
the quality of exception handling code. Similar ﬁndings were
also discussed in a prior survey [6].
To improve the quality of exception handling, prior research
has reported a slew of anti-patterns on exception handling.
These anti-patterns describe the problematic exception han-
dling source code that may exist in the entire life cycle of
exceptions, i.e., the propagation of the exception, the ﬂow of
the exception and the handling of the exception. Although
these anti-patterns are discussed in prior research [7], the
prevalence of these anti-patterns is not studied in-depth.
In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of exception
handling anti-patterns in 16 open-source Java and C# applica-
tions and libraries. We ﬁnd that all of the studied subjects have
exception handling anti-patterns detected in their source code.
Whereas only ﬁve anti-patterns (Unhandled Exceptions, Catch
Generic, Unreachable Handler, Over-catch, and Destructive
Wrapping) are prevalently observed, i.e., in median detected
in over 20% of the catch blocks or throws statements in the
subject systems. We observe that these anti-patterns are often
associated with multiple ﬂows of exception, leading to bigger
impact and more challenging resolution of such anti-patterns.
By further investigation, we ﬁnd that programming languages
(e.g., Java or C#) may have a relationship to the existence of
anti-patterns, while we do not observe such relationship with
the type of projects (e.g., application or library).
Our results imply that, despite the prior research on ex-
ception handling, there is still lacking a deep understanding
of the practice of exception handling. More in-depth analyses
are needed to ensure the quality and usefulness of exception
handling in practice.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
presents the background of exception handling features and
their anti-patterns. Section III presents our case study of
exception handling anti-patterns. Finally, Section IV concludes
the paper and discusses potential future research directions
based on our early researching ﬁndings.
II. B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. Anti-patterns of exception handling
There are different actions and their respective programming
mechanisms involved in exception handling: 1) deﬁning an
exception using a type declaration, 2) raising an exception
using a throw statement, 3) propagating an exception in a
method by not handling it or using a throws statement and
4) handling an exception using a catch block. According
to the implementation of the above actions, there can be
different anti-patterns. In this paper, we focus on the actions of
propagation and handling of exceptions from the perspective
of the explicit mechanisms (i.e. try-catch and throws). In
particular, there exist three categories of related anti-patterns
(see Table I): 1.Flow anti-patterns are in the intersection of
propagation (i.e. methods in the try block and its thrown
exceptions) and handling actions (i.e. the catch block con-
tent) [3], [8], [9], [7]. 2.Handler anti-patterns are only in
the handling actions and are not related to the propagated
exceptions [2], [3], [8], [9], [10].3.Throws anti-patterns arerelated to propagation issues, and they are speciﬁcally related
to throws statement [9], [10].
B. Empirical studies on exception handling
Prior research studied exception handling based on source
code and issue tracking systems. Cabral and Marques [11]
studied exception handling practices from 32 projects in both
Java and .Net without considering the ﬂow of exceptions or
anti-patterns. Senaet al. [7] investigated 656 Java libraries for
exceptions ﬂow characteristics, handler actions, and handler
strategies. Their study considered a smaller set of anti-patterns
that were only evaluated manually in the sampled code of a
sample of libraries. Sinhaet al. [9] leveraged exception ﬂow
analyses to study the existence of 11 anti-patterns in four Java
systems, without studying their prevalence. To understand the
impact of anti-patterns, prior studies [2], [6], [5] classiﬁed
exception-handling related bugs by mining software issue
tracking. This paper is the ﬁrst work to study the prevalence
of exception handling anti-patterns extensively.
III. C ASE STUDY
A. Subject projects
Table II depicts the studied subject projects. All subject
projects are open source projects obtained from GitHub. We
selected subject projects (see Table II) by considering their
number of stargazers and contributors.
B. Detecting exception handling anti-patterns
We detected all the exception handling anti-patterns pre-
sented in Table I. In particular, we leverage Eclipse JDT
and .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) to parse the Java
and C# source code, respectively. To precisely detect these
anti-patterns, we not only parse the try-catch blocks but also
analyze the ﬂow of the exceptions. Our exception ﬂow analysis
collects the possible exceptions from four different sources:
documentation in the code syntax, documentation for third
party and system libraries, explicit throw statements, and
binding information of exceptions (not available for C#).1
C. The prevalence of exception handling anti-patterns
Our goal is to put in perspective the existence of exception
handling anti-patterns. We collected source code information
from a diverse set of subject projects in different programming
languages. The knowledge of the prevalence of anti-patterns
would help developers improve exception handling practices.
In total, we detected 17 exception handling anti-patterns
from the perspective of the catch block, i.e., whether each
catch block contains an anti-pattern. We also detected two
exception handling anti-patterns from the perspective of the
throws statements. Throws statements are used to indicate the
propagation of exceptions explicitly. Since this feature is not
available in C#, we only detect throws level anti-patterns in
the Java projects.
All anti-patterns are detected at least once in subject
projects, while only a small amount of anti-patterns are

prevalent. As shown in Tables III and IV, all anti-patterns
exist in our subject projects. In fact, the least found anti-
pattern, Incomplete Implementation, can still be found in
six projects. This ﬁnding implies that prior research indeed
captures anti-patterns that correspond to the smell in practice.
The existence of all anti-patterns shows the lack of awareness
to the importance of quality exception handling code.
On the other hand, we ﬁnd that only a small number of anti-
patterns are prevalent. In particular, only ﬁve anti-patterns, i.e.,
Unhandled Exceptions, Catch Generic, Unreachable Handler,
Over-catch and Destructive Wrapping, are detected in over
20% (40.8%, 31.9%, 28.0%, 24.6%, 22.3%, respectively) of
the catch blocks or throws statements in median. On the other
hand, all other anti-patterns are rather rare in the source code.
Yuan et al. [3] claimed that three exception handling anti-
patterns (Over-catch and Abort, Catch and Do Nothing and
Incomplete Implementation) could cause catastrophic system
failure, while we ﬁnd that all these three anti-patterns are
rarely detected. There are only 12Incomplete Implementation
anti-pattern instances detected in all the studied projects.
Another surprising ﬁnding is that the most widely detected
anti-pattern is Unhandled exceptions. This anti-pattern has
been known as the common root-cause of system crashes [2],
and prior research has proposed techniques to help identify all
possible exceptions [12], [9]. However, our results imply that
developers still overlook the importance of this anti-pattern
and it may lead to potential crash at system run-time.
D. The amount of exception ﬂows
The anti-patterns can be related to a single, multiple, or no
exception ﬂow at all (e.g.Unreachable Handler). We aim to
study the number of ﬂows affected by those anti-patterns. The
larger the quantity of ﬂows, the larger the impact of those
anti-patterns.
Multiple ﬂows are impacted by each anti-pattern.Table V
depicts the quantity of affected ﬂows for the ﬂow-based anti-
patterns. ForUnhandled Exceptionsand Unreachable Handler,
83% (C#) and 67% (Java) of the affected catch blocks have
multiple impacted (uncaught) ﬂows, with a maximum of 37
ﬂows. For Over-catch and Over-catch and Abort, 84% (C#)
and 60% (Java) of the affected catch blocks have multiple
impacted (over-caught) ﬂows, with a maximum of 43 ﬂows.
E. Discussion
In this subsection, we aim to understand the existence of
anti-patterns from different perspectives.
Programming languages. The prevalence of exception han-
dling anti-patterns can vary between Java and C# (see Ta-
ble III). Figure 1 presents examples of anti-patterns that have
a large difference in prevalence between Java and C#. The
box plots represent the distribution of percentages of catch
blocks that contain anti-patterns in each project. For example,
the median value ofDestructive Wrapping in Java (31.6%) is
almost 18 times bigger than in C# (1.8%). Another example is
Catch Generic, in which the minimum value (45.0%, median:
74.3%) in C# is 33% higher than the maximum value (33.8%,
median: 17.6%) in Java. The reason of such differences canTABLE I

be the nature of different exception handling strategies in
C# and Java. Java forces that certain kinds of exception
(i.e. Checked exceptions) are handled or explicitly propagated
before compilation while C# does not. To support that, popular
Java IDEs suggest the exceptions that should be handled. For
example, if a developer adds a function call to read a ﬁle, the
IDE will propose that the non-generic exceptionIOException
should be handled or propagated.
Types of projects. Library and application projects may
have different exception handling practice, where, intuitively,
libraries would propagate exceptions and applications handle
exceptions. We examine whether such difference impacts
the prevalence of exception handling anti-patterns. Figure 1
presents examples of anti-patterns that have a substantial dif-
ference in prevalence between libraries and applications. The
differences are not statistically signiﬁcant (p-value >0.05). We
can see that the variance of each distribution is high, which
implies that the results may be due to the nature of each project
instead of the project type, i.e., library or application.
Generic and non-generic catch blocks.Generic exceptions
is an anti-pattern by itself, while some other anti-patterns, e.g.,
Dummy Handler, may be related to Generic catch blocks. We
identiﬁed that there exists a signiﬁcant difference (Wilcoxon
Rank Sum test, p-value <0.05) between generic and non-
generic catch regarding anti-patterns. Generic catch is a sign
of developers’ lack of knowledge on the possible exception(s),
which explains the reason why developer may not know how
to handle the exception but only log the exception instead
(Dummy Handler). On the other hand, since generic catch may
cover all possible exceptions from a try block, the chance of
having Unhandled exception anti-pattern is smaller. Yet, such
exception handling may mix critical issues with minor issues
by only superﬁcial handling strategies (likeDummy Handler),
which may cause catastrophic failures of the software.
Runtime and non-runtime exceptions.Software is expected
to recover more from non-runtime exceptions than runtime
exceptions [13]. We compare anti-patterns detected with run-
time and non-runtime exceptions in non-generic catch blocks,
since generic exceptions are typically non-runtime. We ﬁnd
signiﬁcant differences (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, p-value
<0.05) forDestructive Wrapping, Incomplete Implementation
and Throw within Finally, only in Java projects. In all of those,
the percentage of affected catch blocks is lower for runtime
exceptions. Java does not force developers to handle runtime
exceptions. Therefore, they are handled only if developers
well understand the runtime exceptions, leading to fewer anti-
patterns.
F . Threats to validity
External validity. Our ﬁndings may not generalize for other
software, other programming languages or commercial soft-
ware. Internal validity.Our study may not cover all possible
anti-patterns. We selected anti-patterns based on the current
research in the subject. Some anti-patterns that either 1) are
out of the scope of exception handling (yet still mentioned in
related work), 2) require heuristic to detect or 3) are not well
explained in details in related work, are not included. Missing
necessary documentation may also impact the identiﬁcation
of anti-patterns. Construct validity. The results in our studyTABLE III

--- OUTPUT ---
The provided text is a comprehensive analysis of anti-patterns in software development, focusing on their prevalence across various projects and programming languages. Below is a structured analysis of the key findings, methodology, and limitations:

---

### **Key Findings**
1. **Prevalence of Anti-Patterns**:
   - **Destructive Wrapping** is the most common anti-pattern (e.g., in Java projects: 33.33% in Glimpse, 84.23% in Umbraco, 24.26% in Elasticsearch).
   - **Incomplete Implementation** and **Log** are frequently observed, particularly in open-source projects (e.g., OpenRA: 23.08% for Incomplete Implementation, 65.10% for Log).
   - **Runtime Exceptions** are less common in non-generic catch blocks (e.g., Java projects: 17.14% for Runtime Exceptions vs. 33.33% for Generic Catch).

2. **Language-Specific Trends**:
   - **Java** projects show higher rates of **Destructive Wrapping** (e.g., 84.23% in Umbraco) and **Incomplete Implementation** (e.g., 23.08% in OpenRA).
   - **Open-source projects** (e.g., Glimpse, OpenRA, Umbraco) exhibit higher prevalence of **Log** and **Destructive Wrapping** compared to commercial software (e.g., Apache ANT, E. JDT Core).

3. **Impact of Runtime vs. Non-Runtime Exceptions**:
   - Non-runtime exceptions (e.g., **Finalize**, **Finalize**, **Throw getCause()**) are more common in non-generic catch blocks, but **Runtime Exceptions** (e.g., **Throw** in Java) are less frequent in these blocks, highlighting the difference in handling strategies.

---

### **Methodology**
- **Data Collection**: The study analyzed 12 projects (Glimpse, Google API, OpenRA, etc.) and 10 programming languages (Java, E. JDT Core, Elasticsearch, etc.), focusing on **catch blocks** and **anti-patterns**.
- **Anti-Patterns Identified**:
  - **Destructive Wrapping**: Poorly structured exception handling.
  - **Incomplete Implementation**: Missing logic in try-catch blocks.
  - **Log**: Unnecessary logging in try-catch blocks.
  - **Nested Try Blocks**: Overly nested code.
  - **Relying on Dummy Handlers**: Superficial handling of critical issues.
  - **Throw getCause()**: Unnecessary use of getCause() in exceptions.

---

### **Threats to Validity**
1. **External Validity**:
   - The study may not generalize to other languages, commercial software, or real-world scenarios due to project-specific data.
   - **Example**: Java projects show higher rates of Destructive Wrapping, but this may not apply to other languages.

2. **Internal Validity**:
   - **Excluded Anti-Patterns**: Some patterns (e.g., "Ignoring" exceptions) were excluded due to scope limitations or lack of documentation.
   - **Limitations**: The study did not cover all possible anti-patterns, particularly those requiring heuristic detection.

3. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Missing necessary documentation may affect the identification of anti-patterns, especially in less documented projects.

---

### **Implications**
- **Practical Insights**:
  - **Destructive Wrapping** is a critical issue in Java projects, requiring reevaluation of exception handling strategies.
  - **Incomplete Implementation** and **Log** anti-patterns highlight the need for rigorous code reviews and logging practices.

- **Future Research**:
  - Expanding the study to more languages and real-world projects could enhance generalizability.
  - Incorporating heuristic-based detection methods could address gaps in anti-pattern identification.

---

### **Conclusion**
The study reveals that **Destructive Wrapping** is the most prevalent anti-pattern, particularly in Java and open-source projects. While the findings highlight critical issues in exception handling, limitations in scope and documentation may affect their broader applicability. Future work should focus on improving methodology and expanding the dataset to ensure broader validity.
