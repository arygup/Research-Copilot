Abstract
This paper introduces the Encog library for Java and C#, a scalable, adaptable, multi-
platform machine learning framework that was ﬁrst released in 2008 . Encog allows a variety
of machine learning models to be applied to datasets using regression , classiﬁcation, and
clustering. Various supported machine learning models can be used in terchangeably with
minimal recoding. Encog uses eﬃcient multithreaded code to reduce training time by
exploiting modern multicore processors. The current version of En cog can be downloaded
from http://www.encog.org.
Keywords: java, c#, neural network, support vector machine, open sourc e software
1. Intention and Goals
This paper describes the Encog API for Java and C# that is prov ided as a JAR or DLL
library. The C# version of Encog is also compatible with the X amarin Mono package.
Encog has an active community that has provided many enhance ments that are beyond the
scope of this paper. This includes extensions such as Javasc ript, GPU processing, C/C++
support, Scala support, and interfaces to various automate d trading platforms. The scope
of this paper is limited to the Java and C# API.
Encog allows the Java or C# programmer to experiment with a wi de range of ma-
chine language models using a simple, consistent interface for clustering, regression, and
classiﬁcations. This allows the programmer to construct ap plications that discover which
model provides the most suitable ﬁt for the data. Encog provi des basic tools for auto-
mated model selection. Most Encog models are implemented as eﬃcient multithreaded
algorithms to reduce processing time. This often allows Enc og to perform more eﬃciently
than many other Java and C# libraries, as demonstrated empir ically by Taheri (2014) and
Matviykiv and Faitas (2012). Luhasz et al. (2013) and Ramos- Poll´ an et al. (2012) also saw
favorable results when evaluating Encog to similar librari es.
The Encog’s API is presented in an intuitive object-oriente d paradigm that allows vari-
ous models, optimization algorithms, and training algorit hms to be highly interchangeable.
However, beneath the API, the models are represented as one a nd two-dimensional arrays.
This internal representation allows for highly eﬃcient cal culation. The API shields the
programmer from the complexity of model calculation and ﬁtt ing.

Encog contains nearly 400 unit tests to ensure consistency b etween the Java and C#
model implementations. Expected results are calculated an d cross-checked between the two
platforms. A custom pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) i s used in both language’s
unit tests to ensure that even stochastic models produce con sistent, veriﬁable test results.
Encog contains nearly 150 examples to demonstrate the use of the API in a variety
of scenarios. These examples include simple prediction, ti me series, simulation, ﬁnancial
applications, path ﬁnding, curve ﬁtting, and other applica tions. Documentation for Encog
is provided as Java/C# docs and an online wiki. Additionally , discussion groups and a
Stack Overﬂow tag are maintained for support. Links to all of these resources can be found
at http://www.encog.org.
2. Framework Overview
The design goal of Encog is to provide interchangeable model s with eﬃcient, internal imple-
mentations. The Encog framework supports machine learning models with multiple training
algorithms. These models are listed here:
• Adaline, Feedforward, Hopﬁeld, PNN/GRNN, RBF & NEAT neural networks
• generalized linear regression (GLM)
• genetic programming (tree-based)
• k-means clustering
• k-nearest neighbors
• linear regression
• self-organizing map (SOM)
• simple recurrent network (Elman and Jordan)
• support vector machine (SVM)
Encog provides optimization algorithms such as particle sw arm optimization (PSO)
(Poli, 2008), genetic algorithms (GA), Nelder-Mead and sim ulated annealing. These algo-
rithms can optimize a vector to minimize a loss function; con sequently, these algorithms
can ﬁt model parameters to datasets.
Propagation-training algorithms for neural network ﬁttin g, such as back propagation
(Rumelhart et al., 1988), resilient propagation (Riedmill er and Braun, 1992), Levenberg-
Marquardt (Marquardt, 1963), quickpropagation (Fahlman, 1988), and scaled conjugate
gradient (Møller, 1993) are included. Neural network pruni ng and model selection can be
used to ﬁnd optimal network architectures. Neural network a rchitectures can be automati-
cally built by a genetic algorithm using NEAT and HyperNEAT ( Stanley and Miikkulainen,
2002).
A number of preprocessing tools are built into the Encog libr ary. Collected data can be
divided into training, test, and validation sets. Time-ser ies data can be encoded into data
windows. Quantitative data can be normalized by range or z-s core to prevent biases in some
models. Masters (1993) normalizes qualitative data using o ne-of-n encoding or equilateral
encoding. Encog uses these normalization techniques.

Encog also contains extensive support for genetic programm ing using a tree represen-
tation (Koza, 1993). A full set of mathematical and programm ing functions are provided.
Additionally, new functions can be deﬁned. Constant nodes c an either be drawn from a
constant pool or generated as needed. Rules can optionally b e added to simplify expressions
and penalize speciﬁc genome patterns.
3. API Overview
One of the central design philosophies of Encog is to allow mo dels to be quickly interchanged
without a great deal of code modiﬁcation. A classiﬁcation ex ample will demonstrate this
interchangeability, using the iris dataset (Fisher, 1936) . Portions of this classiﬁcation ex-
ample are presented in this paper, using the Java programmin g language. The complete
example, in both Java and C#, is provided in the Encog Quick Start Guide(available from
http://www.encog.org. The Quick Start Guide also provides regression and time-se ries
examples.
The following example learns to predict the species of an iri s ﬂower by using four types
of measurements from each ﬂower. To begin, the program loads the iris dataset’s CSV
ﬁle. In addition to CSV, Encog contains classes to read ﬁxed- length text, JDBC, ODBC,
and XML data sources. The iris dataset is loaded, and the four measurement columns are
deﬁned as continuous values.
VersatileDataSource source = new CSVDataSource(irisFile, false,
CSVFormat.DECIMAL_POINT);
VersatileMLDataSet data = new VersatileMLDataSet(source);
data.defineSourceColumn("sepal-length", 0, ColumnType.continuous);
data.defineSourceColumn("sepal-width", 1, ColumnType.continuous);
data.defineSourceColumn("petal-length", 2, ColumnType.continuous);
data.defineSourceColumn("petal-width", 3, ColumnType.continuous);
The species of Iris is deﬁned as nominal value. Deﬁning the co lumns as continuous,
nominal or ordinal allows Encog to determine the appropriat e way to encode these data for
a model. For specialized cases, it is possible to override En cog’s encoding defaults for any
model type.
ColumnDefinition outputColumn = data.defineSourceColumn("species", 4,
ColumnType.nominal);
Once the columns have been deﬁned, the ﬁle is analyzed to dete rmine minimum, maximum,
and other statistical properties of the columns. This allow s the columns to be properly
normalized and encoded by Encog for modeling.
data.analyze();
data.defineSingleOutputOthersInput(outputColumn);
Next the model type is deﬁned to be a feedforward neural netwo rk.
EncogModel model = new EncogModel(data);
model.selectMethod(data, MLMethodFactory.TYPE_FEEDFORWARD);
Only the above line needs to be changed to switch to model type s that include the following:
• MLMethodFactory.SVM: support vector machine
• MLMethodFactory.TYPE
RBFNETWORK: RBF neural network
3Heaton
• MLMethodFactor.TYPE NEAT: NEAT neural network
• MLMethodFactor.TYPE PNN: probabilistic neural network
Next the dataset is normalized and encoded. Encog will autom atically determine the
correct normalization type based on the model chosen in the l ast step. For model validation,
30% of the data are held back. Though the validation sampling is random, a seed of 1001
is used so that the items selected for validation remain cons tant between program runs.
Finally, the default training type is selected.
data.normalize();
model.holdBackValidation(0.3, true, 1001);
model.selectTrainingType(data);
The example trains using a 5-fold cross-validated techniqu e that chooses the model with
the best validation score. The resulting training and valid ation errors are displayed.
MLRegression bestMethod = (MLRegression)model.crossvalidate(5, true);
System.out.println( "Training error: " + EncogUtility.calculateRegressionError(
bestMethod, model.getTrainingDataset()));
System.out.println( "Validation error: " + EncogUtility.calculateRegressionError
(bestMethod, model.getValidationDataset()));
Display normalization parameters and ﬁnal model.
NormalizationHelper helper = data.getNormHelper();
System.out.println(helper.toString());
System.out.println("Final model: " + bestMethod);
4. Future Plans and Conclusions
A number of enhancements are planned for Encog. Gradient boo sting machines (GBM) and
deep learning are two future model additions. Several plann ed enhancements will provide
interoperability with other machine learning packages. Fu ture versions of Encog will have
the ability to read and write Weka Attribute-Relation File F ormat (ARFF) and libsvm data
ﬁles. Encog will gain the ability to load and save models in th e Predictive Model Markup
Language (PMML) format. A code contribution by Mosca (2012) will soon be integrated,
enhancing Encog’s ensemble learning capabilities.
