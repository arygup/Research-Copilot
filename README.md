# Research CoPilot: Agentic AI using MOYA

This project focuses on building a multi-agent system using the [MOYA](https://montycloud.github.io/moya/index.html) framework. The goal is to engineer a research co-pilot that can search, parse, analyze, and synthesize academic research papers on a given topic.

---

## Project Goal

The system acts as an AI powered research assistant capable of:

1. Mining research papers from open access sources (via arXiv).
2. Parsing and summarizing each paper in a structured manner.
3. Synthesizing cross paper insights and identifying research gaps.
4. Generating a concise ~800 word mini survey with citations.

## Framework & Tools Used

* **MOYA Framework**: For building agentic systems with tool usage and logging support.
* **Ollama + Qwen 3 (1.7b)**: Local LLM backend.
* **arXiv API**: For searching and downloading research papers.
* **PyPDF**: For PDF parsing.
* **Trace Logging**: All agent actions, tool usage, and outputs are logged to `trace.jsonl`.

## System Architecture

### Agents

1. **SummarizerAgent**: Extracts structured summaries from individual papers.
2. **SynthesizerAgent**: Analyzes multiple summaries to identify trends, contradictions, and research gaps.
3. **WriterAgent**: Produces a final academic style mini survey with inline citations and structured writing.

### Tools

* `ArxivSearchTool`: Searches arXiv using a topic query and downloads top N relevant PDFs.
* `PDFParserTool`: Extracts plain text from PDF files using `PyPDF`.
* `SimpleVectorStore`: Stores all summaries with associated metadata for later access.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Search & Download Papers

* User provides a research topic and number of papers.
* The `ArxivSearchTool` uses the `arxiv` Python package to find and download relevant papers.

### Step 2: Parse & Summarize Papers

* Each PDF is parsed using `PDFParserTool`.
* The first 20,000 characters of text (changes with LLM context window) are sent to `SummarizerAgent`.
* The agent returns a structured summary with:

  * **Problem Statement**
  * **Methodology**
  * **Key Results**

### Step 3: Synthesize Insights

* All summaries are passed to the `SynthesizerAgent`.
* This agent identifies:

  * Common themes
  * Unique contributions
  * Research gaps

### Step 4: Generate Mini Survey

* The final synthesis, topic, and references are compiled into a prompt.
* `WriterAgent` generates a mini survey (~800 words) with inline citations.
* The output is saved to `report.md`.

---

## Output Files

* `trace.jsonl`: Full execution log (all agent prompts, responses, tool calls).
* `logs/`: Interaction logs for summaries, synthesis, and report.
* `report.md`: Final mini survey generated by the system.

---

## Reproducibility & Observability

* All runs are **deterministic** due to fixed `temperature = 0.0` and `seed = 42`.
* All key interactions and decisions are **logged** in `trace.jsonl`.
* Each agent is separately configurable for modular testing and debugging.

##  Assistance

Parts of this project were assisted using Google Gemini, mainly as a coding asistant. However, the final implementation, testing, and integration with the MOYA framework were completed and validated independently.
